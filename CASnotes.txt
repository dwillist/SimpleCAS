TODO:
1- Re-consider SimplifyFunctions Base Rational function. Need to come up with a better
  definition of simplification before writing this. Really would be nice to avoid loops as well
2- *Test functions of BigInt class (might never use due to boost)
3- need to have some sort of class for collecting constants that we cannot simplify to rationals
4- productSimplify and sumSimplfy are quite similar some refactoring may be in order.

5- might need to implement some custom numerical type to allow for prime factorization of large
   integers so that comparisons are more efficient.

NOTE:
  compilation may require c++11 due to initializing vectors and default < operator used in vectors
